## Three waves of AI

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is the field of computer science that focuses on **creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.**

AI is when computers or systems can **think, learn, and make decisions like humans**—but faster and often at a much larger scale.

### Predictive AI

**Predictive AI** is a type of artificial intelligence that analyzes existing data to **make predictions about future outcomes**.

It uses patterns in historical data to **forecast what might happen next**.

#### 🔍 How it works:

1. **Data Collection** – Collect past data (e.g., sales, weather, user behavior).
2. **Model Training** – Use machine learning models to find patterns.
3. **Prediction** – Apply the model to new data to predict future results.

#### 📦 Real-World Examples:

- **E-commerce**: Predict what a customer will buy next.
- **Healthcare**: Forecast disease risks.
- **Finance**: Anticipate stock market trends or credit risk.
- **Manufacturing**: Predict when a machine might fail (predictive maintenance).

### Generative AI

**Generative AI** is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create new content**—like text, images, music, code, or even videos—based on the data it has learned from.

Generative AI doesn’t just _analyze_ data—it actually **creates** something new from it.

#### 🛠️ What it can generate:

- 📝 **Text** – Like ChatGPT writing stories, emails, or summaries
- 🎨 **Images** – Like DALL·E or Midjourney creating art from prompts
- 🎶 **Music** – AI composing original songs
- 🎥 **Videos** – AI generating realistic video clips
- 💻 **Code** – AI writing or debugging software

#### ⚙️ How it works (simplified):

1. It’s trained on a huge amount of existing data (like books, images, code, etc.)
2. It learns the patterns in that data
3. You give it a **prompt** (like “Draw a cat wearing sunglasses”)
4. It generates **new content** that matches what you asked for

#### 🔥 Popular Generative AI tools:

- **ChatGPT** – Text
- **DALL·E, Midjourney** – Images
- **GitHub Copilot** – Code
- **Runway ML, Sora** – Video

### Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** is a type of artificial intelligence that goes beyond just responding—it can **take initiative**, **make decisions**, and **act independently** to complete tasks or achieve goals.

Agentic AI is like giving an AI a **mission**, and it figures out *how* to do it—on its own.


#### ⚙️ Core features of Agentic AI:
1. **Autonomy** – Acts without constant human input  
2. **Goal-oriented** – Works toward defined objectives  
3. **Decision-making** – Chooses actions based on data and context  
4. **Memory & Learning** – Remembers past actions and learns over time  
5. **Multi-step Reasoning** – Handles complex tasks step-by-step

#### 🤖 Example:
You say: “Book my flight, hotel, and create a travel itinerary for Tokyo next month.”

A basic AI might just show you links.

An **Agentic AI** will:
- Search flights based on your calendar
- Compare hotels near your meetings
- Build a full travel plan
- Book everything (with permission)
- Notify you of changes while traveling

#### 🛠 Tools for building Agentic AI:
- **LangChain**, **AutoGPT**, **OpenAI Agents SDK**  
- **Dapr**, **MCP Servers**, **Knowledge Graphs**  
- Used with **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, etc.

#### 🚀 Why it matters:
Agentic AI is the backbone of the future—handling **enterprise automation**, **personal assistants**, **robotics**, and **intelligent decision-making systems**.

Absolutely! This image is a **visual summary of AI Agents**—how they work, the types, and how they are structured in systems. Here's a breakdown of each section:

## ✅ **How AI Agents Work**

- **AI Agent** :
  - Can **act autonomously** (take action without human help)
  - Uses **memory** to remember things
  - Has **reactivity** to respond to changes in the **environment**
  - Is under some **human control** (can receive tasks)
  - Can **access tools**:
    - **APIs** to call external services
    - **Internet** for information
    - **Code interpreters** for logic and automation
  - Can delegate tasks to some other agents

💡 **Bottom line**: The AI agent can observe, think, decide, and act—just like a digital assistant with a brain, eyes, and hands.

## 🧠 **Types of AI Agents**

These are the categories of AI agents based on intelligence and behavior:

- **Simple Reflex Agents**: React to the current situation only (no memory).
- **Model-Based Reflex Agents**: Consider both current input and memory of past events.
- **Goal-Based Agents**: Choose actions to achieve specific goals.
- **Utility-Based Agents**: Aim to maximize usefulness or performance, not just achieve goals.
- **Learning Agents**: Improve over time by learning from past experiences.


## 🏗️ **AI Agent System Architecture**

How agents are organized:

- **Single Agent**: Acts alone—like a personal assistant (e.g., ChatGPT).
- **Multi-Agent**: Agents collaborate and communicate with each other.
- **Human-Machine**: AI works *with* humans (e.g., co-pilots, customer support bots).

💡 This shows whether the AI is working solo, with other AIs, or with people.

## **ANI, AGI, and ASI**:

### 🤖 **ANI – Artificial Narrow Intelligence**
- **Also called**: Weak AI  
- **What it is**: AI that is good at doing *one* specific task.  
- **Examples**:
  - Google Maps (gives directions)
  - ChatGPT (conversational AI)
  - Facial recognition in phones
  - Spam filters in email  
- **Limitations**: Can’t do anything outside its trained function.

### 🧠 **AGI – Artificial General Intelligence**
- **Also called**: Strong AI  
- **What it is**: AI with human-like intelligence; can learn and perform *any* task a human can.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Doesn’t exist yet.  
  - Imagine an AI that can write code, cook a meal, paint art, and understand emotions—just like a human.  
- **Goal**: To create machines that can think, learn, and adapt like us.

### 🚀 **ASI – Artificial Super Intelligence**
- **What it is**: AI that surpasses human intelligence in *every* aspect—creativity, decision-making, emotions, etc.  
- **Examples**:
  - Purely hypothetical for now.  
  - Think of a super-intelligent AI that can solve global problems faster than any human ever could.  
- **Concerns**: Could be powerful but risky if not controlled properly.
