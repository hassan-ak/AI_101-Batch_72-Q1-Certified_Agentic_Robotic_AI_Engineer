# Assignment 03: Python Crash Course Practice (Chapters 2 & 3)

Welcome to the practice set for **Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)** by Eric Matthes!

This README contains **20 carefully crafted questions** based on:

- **Chapter 2**: Variables and Simple Data Types
- **Chapter 3**: Introducing Lists

The focus is on **logic building** and **problem solving**, ranging from **basic** to **advanced** levels.
Absolutely — we can **estimate a realistic time** based on the type of questions and beginner speed.

Here’s a thoughtful breakdown:

| **Section**                         | **Estimated Time** per Question | **Total Time** | **Notes** |
|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Basic (15 questions)                | 5–10 minutes each              | 1.5–2.5 hours | Simple print statements, variables, list basics |
| Intermediate (10 questions)          | 10–15 minutes each             | 1.5–2.5 hours | Small logic like loops, sorting, input, math |
| Advanced (5 questions)               | 15–25 minutes each             | 1.5–2 hours  | Requires thinking, filtering, edge cases |
| Bonus Challenge (Optional)           | 20–30 minutes                  | 0.5 hour    | If attempted |

# 📋 **Overall Estimate for a Beginner:**

| **Task**                       | **Time**       |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------|
| Solving all 30 main questions   | 4.5–7 hours    |
| Bonus Challenge (optional)      | +0.5 hour      |
| **Total Estimated Time**        | **5–7.5 hours** |

# 📢 Important Notes:
- **If working in one sitting**: Suggest **two sessions** of **3–4 hours each** (with breaks).
- **If spread over days**: 2–3 days with daily **2–2.5 hours** would be ideal for beginners.
- **Extra Time**: Always add **30 minutes extra** for setting up Google Colab, reading instructions, and fixing small mistakes.

# 🎯 Suggested Instructions (for your assignment note):
> ⏰ Estimated Completion Time for Beginners: **5 to 7.5 hours**  
> 💡 Recommendation: Break it into **2 sessions** or **spread over 2–3 days** to maximize learning.  
> 📚 Focus on **understanding concepts**, not rushing through.

# 📚 Practice Questions

## Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types (15 Questions)

### Basic

1. Create a variable called `greeting` and store any message. Print it.
2. Change the value of `greeting` to a new message. Print the updated message.
3. Create two variables `first_name` and `last_name`. Combine them into a full name using an f-string.
4. Print a quote along with the author's name using an f-string.
5. Store a person's name with extra spaces. Strip the spaces before printing.

### Intermediate

6. Take a number, add 5, multiply by 2, subtract 3, and print the final result.
7. Create two numbers `a` and `b` and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
8. Find the square and cube of a number using the `**` operator.
9. Print the sum of three floating-point numbers.
10. Assign three variables `x, y, z` in a single line and print them.

## Chapter 3: Introducing Lists (15 Questions)

### Basic

11. Create a list of 5 favorite fruits and print each fruit separately.
12. Modify the second item in the list and print the updated list.
13. Append a new fruit and insert another at the beginning of the list.
14. Demonstrate deleting an item using `del`, `pop()`, and `remove()`.
