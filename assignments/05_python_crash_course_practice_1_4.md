### Question 01. Palindrome Check

- Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints whether it is a palindrome (a string that reads the same forwards and backwards). Test the code with twi cases one where the input string is a palindrome and the other where it is not a palindrome.

---

### Question 02. Formatted Table

- Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains an item name (string) and its price (float).First print the list and then Use a for loop to print each item and its price along with serial number, aligned using the tab escape character.

### Question 03. Vowel Counter

- Given a string sentence, write a program that counts and print how many vowels it contains.
  - print the original string
  - print the count of vowels
---

### Question 04. Discount Calculator

- You have a list of product prices (floats), e.g. [19.99, 5.50, 100.0]. Apply a 15% discount to each price and store the new prices in a separate list. Then print original list, discounted list and each original and discounted price side by side.
---

### Question 05. Phone Number Formatter

- You have a list of 11-digit strings like ["03123456789", "03001234567"]. Convert each into the format "+92-XXX-XXXXXXX" and print them. Print Original and Formatted number side by side.

---

### Question 06. Score Statistics

- You have a tuple of exam scores, e.g. (72, 85, 91, 58, 76).
   - print the provided tuple 
   - Convert it to a list and print it.
   - Compute and print the minimum, maximum, and average score.

### Question 07. Reverse Each Word in a Sentence
- Given a sentence string, reverse each word individually but keep the word order.
  - print the original sentence
  - print the formatted sentence
---

### Question 08. Running Sum List

- From a given list create a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements (inclusive). Print both the lists.
---

### Question 09. Interleave Two Lists

- Combine two equal-length lists into a single one by alternating elements.
  - Input: [1, 2, 3] and ['a', 'b', 'c']
  - Output: [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']
- Print all three lists.

---

### Question 10. Repeat Letters

- Given a string, return a new string where each letter is repeated twice. Print both the strings
